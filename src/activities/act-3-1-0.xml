  <statement>
    <p>Let <m>f(x) = x^{7/3} - 7x^{1/3}</m>.</p>

      <ol label="a.">
        <li>
          <p>
            Find all the critical numbers of <m>f</m>.
            (Hint: after finding the derivative, factor out <m>x^{-2/3}</m>.)

            For each critical number <m>x=a</m>, evaluate a decimal approximation of <m>f'(x)</m> at a number very close to <m>a</m> but less than it,
            and at a number very close to <m>a</m> but greater than it.
            Use this to determine whether <m>f</m> has a local maximum, local minimum, or neither at that critical number.

            Suppose <m>g</m> is an arbitrary function that is defined and differentiable except at a finite number of points.
            At what kinds of points can the sign of its derivative <m>g'</m> change?

            How could you have used your answer to part (c) to reduce the number of points you had to evaluate <m>f'(x)</m> at in part (b)?

            At points where <m>g'</m> is zero or undefined.
            That is, at the critical numbers and at points where <m>g</m> is undefined.

        <li>
          <p>
            We only needed to evaluate <m>g'</m> at one point in between -1 and 0, and at one point in between 0 and 1.
