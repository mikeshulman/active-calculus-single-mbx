    <p permid="JFY">
      Because differential calculus is based on the definition of the derivative,
      and the definition of the derivative involves a limit,
      there is a sense in which all of calculus rests on limits.
      In addition,
      the limit involved in the definition of the derivative always generates the indeterminate form <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>.
      If <m>f</m> is a differentiable function,
      then in the definition
      <me permid="CLt">
        f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
      </me>,
      not only does <m>h \to 0</m> in the denominator,
      but also <m>(f(x+h)-f(x)) \to 0</m> in the numerator,
      since <m>f</m> is continuous.
      Remember, saying that a limit has an indeterminate form only means that we don't yet know its value and have more work to do:
      indeed, limits of the form
      <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> can take on any value,
      as is evidenced by evaluating <m>f'(x)</m> for varying values of <m>x</m> for a function such as <m>f'(x) = x^2</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="pNh">
      We have learned many techniques for evaluating the limits that result from the derivative definition,
      including a large number of shortcut rules.
      In this section, we turn the situation upside-down:
      instead of using limits to evaluate derivatives,
      we explore how to use derivatives to evaluate certain limits.

    <p permid="VUq">
      The idea demonstrated in <xref ref="PA-2-8">Preview Activity</xref>
      <mdash /> that we can evaluate an indeterminate limit of the form
      <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> by replacing each of the numerator and denominator with their local linearizations at the point of interest <mdash /> can be generalized in a way that enables us to evaluate a wide range of limits.
      We have a function <m>h(x)</m> that can be written as a quotient
      <m>h(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m>,
      where <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are both differentiable at <m>x=a</m> and for which <m>f(a) = g(a) = 0</m>.
      We would like to evaluate the indeterminate limit given by
      <m>\lim_{x \to a} h(x)</m>.
      <xref ref="F-2-8-LHR">Figure</xref> illustrates the situation.
      We see that both <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> have an <m>x</m>-intercept at <m>x = a</m>.
      Their respective tangent line approximations <m>L_f</m> and <m>L_g</m> at <m>x = a</m>
      are also shown in the figure.
      We can take advantage of the fact that a function and its tangent line approximation become indistinguishable as <m>x \to a</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Cbz">
      First, let's recall that <m>L_f(x) = f'(a)(x-a) + f(a)</m> and <m>L_g(x) = g'(a)(x-a) +g(a)</m>.
      Because <m>x</m> is getting arbitrarily close to <m>a</m> when we take the limit,
      we can replace <m>f</m> with <m>L_f</m> and replace <m>g</m> with <m>L_g</m>,
      and thus we observe that
      <md permid="iSC">
        <mrow>\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} =\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to a} \frac{L_f(x)}{L_g(x)}</mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(a)(x-a) + f(a)}{g'(a)(x-a) + g(a)}</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>

    <p permid="iiI">
      Next, we remember that both <m>f(a) = 0</m> and <m>g(a) = 0</m>,
      which is precisely what makes the original limit indeterminate.
      Substituting these values for <m>f(a)</m> and <m>g(a)</m> in the limit above,
      we now have
      <md permid="vgU">
        <mrow>\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} =\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(a)(x-a)}{g'(a)(x-a)}</mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}</mrow>
      </md>,
      where the latter equality holds because
      <m>\frac{x-a}{x-a} = 1</m> when <m>x</m> is approaching
      (but not equal to) <m>a</m>.
      Finally, we note that <m>\frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}</m> is constant with respect to <m>x</m>, and thus
      <me permid="OZL">
        \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="OpR">
      This result holds as long as <m>g'(a)</m> is not equal to zero.
      The formal name of the result is L'Hôpital's Rule.
    </p>

    <assemblage permid="KLr">
      <title>L'Hôpital's Rule</title>
      <idx><h>L'Hôpital's rule</h></idx>

      <p permid="uxa">
        Let <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> be differentiable on some open interval containing <m>x=a</m>,
        and suppose that <m>f(a) = g(a) = 0</m> and that <m>g'(a) \neq 0</m>.
        Then <m>\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}</m>.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p permid="aEj">
      In practice,
      we typically work with a slightly more general version of L'Hôpital's Rule,
      which states that, if <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are differentiable on an open interval containing <m>x=a</m>,
      <m>f(a) = g(a) = 0</m>, and <m>g'</m> is continuous at <m>x=a</m>, then
      <me permid="bod">
        \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}
      </me>,
      provided the righthand limit exists.
      In particular, this version allows us to apply L'Hôpital's Rule more than once:
      if it turns out that <m>f'(a) = g'(a) = 0</m> as well,
      we can proceed to <m>\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f''(x)}{g''(x)}</m>, and so on.
    </p>

    <p permid="GLs">
      For example,
      if we consider the limit from <xref ref="PA-2-8">Preview Activity</xref>,
      <me permid="Hvm">
        \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^5 + x - 2}{x^2 - 1}
      </me>,
      by L'Hôpital's Rule we have that
      <me permid="nCv">
        \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^5 + x - 2}{x^2 - 1} = \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{5x^4 + 1}{2x} = \frac{6}{2} = 3. \\
      </me>
    </p>

    <p permid="mSB">
      By replacing the numerator and denominator with their respective derivatives,
      we often replace an indeterminate limit with one whose value we can easily determine.
    </p>

    <xi:include href="./activities/act-2-8-1.xml" />

    <p permid="SZK">
      While L'Hôpital's Rule can be applied in an entirely algebraic way, 
      it is important to remember that the justification of the rule is graphical:
      the main idea is that the slopes of the tangent lines to <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> at <m>x = a</m> determine the value of the limit of <m>\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m> as <m>x \to a</m>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-2-8-LHR2" permid="rCu">
      <caption>Two functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> that satisfy L'Hôpital's Rule.</caption>
      <image width="100%" source="images/2_8_LHR2" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="zgT">
      We see this in <xref ref="F-2-8-LHR2">Figure</xref>,
      where we can see from the grid that
      <m>f'(a) = 2</m> and <m>g'(a) = -1</m>,
      hence by L'Hôpital's Rule,
      <me permid="TJE">
        \lim_{x \to a}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)} = \frac{2}{-1} = -2
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="foc">
      It's not the fact that <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> both approach zero that matters most,
      but rather the <em>rate</em>
      at which each approaches zero that determines the value of the limit.
      This is a good way to remember what L'Hôpital's Rule says:
      if <m>f(a) = g(a) = 0</m>,
      the the limit of <m>\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m> as <m>x \to a</m> is given by the ratio of the slopes of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> at <m>x = a</m>.

    <title>Limits involving <m>\infty</m></title>
    <p permid="XJD">
      The concept of infinity,
          <idx><h>infinity</h></idx>
      denoted <m>\infty</m>, arises naturally in calculus,
      as it does in much of mathematics.
      It is important to note from the outset that <m>\infty</m> is a concept,
      but not a number itself.
      Indeed, the notion of <m>\infty</m> naturally invokes the idea of limits.
      Consider, for example, the function <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m>,
      whose graph is pictured in <xref ref="F-2-8-Infty">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <p permid="DQM">
      We note that <m>x = 0</m> is not in the domain of <m>f</m>,
      so we may naturally wonder what happens as <m>x \to 0</m>.
      As <m>x \to 0^+</m> (which, recall, means that <m>x</m> approaches 0 through positive values only), we observe that <m>f(x)</m>
      <em>increases without bound</em>.
      That is, we can make the value of <m>f(x)</m> as large as we like by taking <m>x</m> closer and closer
      (but not equal)
      to 0, while keeping <m>x \gt 0</m>.
      This is a good way to think about what infinity represents:
      a quantity is tending to infinity if there is no single number that the quantity is always less than.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-2-8-Infty" permid="KpS">
      <caption>The graph of <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m>.</caption>

    </figure>

    <p permid="jXV">
      Recall that the statement <m>\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L</m>,
      means that we can make <m>f(x)</m> as close to <m>L</m> as we'd like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close
      (but not equal)
      to <m>a</m>.
      We now expand this notation and language to include the possibility that either <m>L</m> or <m>a</m> can be <m>\infty</m>.
      For instance, for <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m>, we now write
      <me permid="zQN">
        \lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{1}{x} = \infty
      </me>,
      by which we mean that we can make
      <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> as large as we like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close
      (but not equal)
      to 0 (and greater than it).
      In a similar way, we write
      <me permid="fXW">
        \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{x} = 0
      </me>,
      since we can make <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> as close to 0 as we'd like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently large (i.e., by letting <m>x</m> increase without bound).
    </p>

    <p permid="Qfe">
      In general, the notation
      <m>\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \infty</m> means that we can make <m>f(x)</m> as large as we like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close
      (but not equal)
      to <m>a</m>, and the notation
      <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = L</m>  means that we can make <m>f(x)</m> as close to <m>L</m> as we like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently large.
      Similarly, we can consider limits involving <m>-\infty</m>.
      For example, returning to <xref ref="F-2-8-Infty">Figure</xref>
      and <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m>, we can say that
      <me permid="Mff">
        \lim_{x \to 0^-} \frac{1}{x} = -\infty \ \ \text{and}  \ \ \lim_{x \to -\infty} \frac{1}{x} = 0.
      </me>
      The first means that we can make <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> as negative as we like (i.e., as far from 0 in the negative direction)
      by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close (but not equal) to 0 (and less than it)
      The second means that we can make <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> as close to 0 as we want by taking <m>x</m> to be sufficiently negative.
    </p>

    <p permid="wmn">
      Finally, we write
      <me permid="smo">
        \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = \infty
      </me>
      if we can make the value of <m>f(x)</m> as large as we'd like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently large,
      and similarly if either or both infinities are negative.
      For example,

      Here we briefly examine some familiar functions and note the values of several limits involving <m>\infty</m>.

      For the exponential decay function <m>e^{-x}</m>,
      these limits are reversed,
      with <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} e^{-x} = 0</m> and <m>\lim_{x \to -\infty} e^{-x} = \infty</m>.
      Turning to the natural logarithm function,
      we have <m>\lim_{x \to 0^+} \ln(x) = -\infty</m> and <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} \ln(x) = \infty</m>.

          Note that at any point where the denominator is nonzero, the function <m>q</m> is continuous, and thus its limit is finite.
          Therefore, vertical asymptotes can only occur where the denominator equals zero.
          Factoring the denominator we get
          <me>
            7x^2 + 9x - 10 = (7x-5)(x+2)
          </me>
          so the potential asymptotes are <m>x = \frac{5}{7}</m> and <m>x=-2</m>, and thus there are four potentially infinite limits:
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to \frac{5}{7}^-} q(x) \ \ 
            \lim_{x\to \frac{5}{7}^+} q(x) \ \ 
            \lim_{x\to -2^-} q(x) \ \ 
            \lim_{x\to -2^+} q(x).
          </me>
          Consider, for instance, <m>\lim_{x\to -2^-} q(x)</m>.
          The numerator <m>3x^2 - 4x + 5</m> is continuous, so as <m>x\to -2</m> it approaches its value 25.
          Similarly, the other factor <m>7x+5</m> approaches its value -9.
          And when <m>x</m> is close to -2 but less than it, <m>x+2</m> is close to zero and less than it.
          Thus, the entire function <m>q(x)</m> is of the form <m>\frac{25}{-9 \cdot e}</m> where <m>e</m> is negative and very close to zero.
          Dividing by something very close to zero gives something very far from zero,
          and combining this with the sign rule for multiplication and division we conclude that <m>\lim_{x\to -2^-} q(x) = \infty</m>.
          Similarly, we find
          <me>
            \lim_{x\to \frac{5}{7}^-} q(x) = -\infty \ \ 
            \lim_{x\to \frac{5}{7}^+} q(x) = \infty \ \ 
            \lim_{x\to -2^-} q(x) = \infty \ \ 
            \lim_{x\to -2^+} q(x) = -\infty.
          </me>
          These are the <q>infinite limits</q>, showing that <m>q</m> has vertical asymptotes at <m>x=\frac{5}{7}</m> and <m>x=-2</m>.
        </p>

        <p permid="dyP">
          Now consider horizontal asymptotes: that is, the values of <m>\lim_{x\to \pm\infty} q(x)</m>.
          Note that both <m>(3x^2 - 4x + 5) \to \infty</m> as <m>x \to \infty</m> and
          <m>(7x^2 + 9x - 10) \to \infty</m> as <m>x \to \infty</m>.
          Here we say that <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} q(x)</m> has indeterminate form <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m>.
          But we can determine the value of this limit through a standard algebraic approach.
          Multiplying the numerator and denominator each by <m>\frac{1}{x^2}</m>,
          we find that
          <md permid="QOY">
            <mrow>\lim_{x \to \infty} q(x) =\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{3x^2 - 4x + 5}{7x^2 + 9x - 10} \cdot \frac{\frac{1}{x^2}}{\frac{1}{x^2}}</mrow>
            <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{3 - 4\frac{1}{x} + 5\frac{1}{x^2}}{7 + 9\frac{1}{x} - 10\frac{1}{x^2}} = \frac{3}{7}</mrow>
          </md>
          since <m>\frac{1}{x^2} \to 0</m> and
          <m>\frac{1}{x} \to 0</m> as <m>x \to \infty</m>.
          The same reasoning applies as <m>x\to -\infty</m>.
          These are the <q>limits at infinity</q>, showing that <m>q</m> has a horizontal asymptote at <m>y = \frac{3}{7}</m>.

    <title>L'Hôpital's Rule for <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m></title>

    <p permid="Nky">
      The techniques introduced in the previous section allow us to compute many limits involving <m>\pm\infty</m>, but not all of them.
      For instance, how should we handle a limit such as
      <me permid="wWh">
        \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2}{e^x}?
      </me>
    </p>

    <p permid="trH">
      Here, both <m>x^2 \to \infty</m> and <m>e^x \to \infty</m>,
      but there is not an obvious algebraic approach that enables us to find the limit's value.
      Fortunately, with a trick we can again apply L'Hôpital's Rule.
      The version of L'Hôpital's Rule stated above only applies to the indeterminate form <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>, whereas here we have the indeterminate form <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m>, but we can convert the one into the other as follows:
      <me>
        \frac{x^2}{e^x} = \frac{1/e^{x}}{1/x^2}.
      </me>
      Now both <m>1/e^{x}</m> and <m>1/x^2</m> approach 0 as <m>x\to\infty</m>, so we can apply L'Hôpital's Rule:
      <me>
        \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{x^2}{e^x}
        = \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{1/e^{x}}{1/x^2}
        = \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{-1/e^{x}}{-2/x^3}
        = \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{x^2}{e^x} \cdot \frac{x}{2}.
      </me>
      In other words, the limit of <m>\frac{x^2}{e^x}</m> is equal to the limit of <em>itself</em> multiplied by <m>\frac{x}{2}</m>.
      But <m>\frac{x}{2} \to \infty</m> as <m>x\to \infty</m>, so the only way that multiplying by this quantity can leave the limit of <m>\frac{x^2}{e^x}</m> unchanged is if the latter equals zero:
      <me>
        \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{x^2}{e^x} = 0.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      A similar trick works for an arbitrary quotient.
      Suppose <m>f(x)\to \infty</m> and <m>g(x)\to\infty</m> as <m>x\to a</m>, and write
      <me>
        \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}
        = \lim_{x\to a} \frac{1/g(x)}{1/f(x)}
        = \lim_{x\to a} \frac{-g'(x)/[g(x)]^2}{-f'(x)/[f(x)]^2}
        = \lim_{x\to a} \left(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{g'(x)}{f'(x)}.
      </me>
      If we assume that all the limits involve exist and are nonzero, we can write this as
      <me>
        \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \left(\lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right)^2 \cdot \lim_{x\to a} \frac{g'(x)}{f'(x)}
      </me>
      and some algebra and cancellation yields the following formula.
      (If one or the other limit is not known to exist or equals zero, a more complicated argument is required, but the result is still valid.)

      (To be technically correct,

    <p permid="lNi">
      Now we can evaluate <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2}{e^x}</m> more simply using L'Hôpital's Rule,
      since both <m>x^2 \to \infty</m> and <m>e^x \to \infty</m>.
      Doing so, it follows that
      <me permid="Jkz">
        \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2}{e^x} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{2x}{e^x}

    </p>

    <p permid="RUr">
      This updated limit is still indeterminate and of the form <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m>,
      but it is simpler since <m>2x</m> has replaced <m>x^2</m>.
      Hence, we can apply L'Hôpital's Rule again, and find that
      <me permid="prI">
        \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2}{e^x} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{2x}{e^x} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{2}{e^x}

    <p permid="ybA">
      Now, since <m>2</m> is constant and

      it follows that <m>\frac{2}{e^x} \to 0</m> as <m>x \to \infty</m>,
      so we again get the same answer

      To evaluate the limit of a quotient of two functions
      <m>\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m> that results in an indeterminate form of <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m>,
      in essence we are asking which function is growing faster without bound.
      We say that the function <m>g</m> <em>dominates</em>
      the function <m>f</m> as <m>x \to \infty</m> provided that
      <me permid="BGa">
        \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0

      whereas <m>f</m> dominates <m>g</m> provided that <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \infty</m>.
      Finally, if the value of <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m> is finite and nonzero,
      we say that <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>
      <em>grow at the same rate</em>.
      For example,
      we saw that <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2}{e^x} = 0</m>,
      so <m>e^x</m> dominates <m>x^2</m>,
      while <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{3x^2 - 4x + 5}{7x^2 + 9x - 10} = \frac{3}{7}</m>,
      so <m>f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 5</m> and
      <m>g(x) = 7x^2 + 9x - 10</m> grow at the same rate.
